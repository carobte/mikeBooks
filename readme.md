# Project Name: MikeBooks

## Category:
<p> Entertainment </p>

## General Objective:
<p> Connect the reading community of the "Valle de Aburrá" to facilitate the exchange or sale of books. </p>

## Project Proposal:
<p> There are multiple reasons why people buy physical books: because they prefer having it physically over a PDF version, because they like the author, because it has been recommended to them, because they are familiar with the literary universe, because it catches their attention at the moment, among others. Over time, these initial motivations may change, as can the perspective of the books that were acquired. Often, this results in the user no longer wanting to keep them, either because they did not like the book initially or because their tastes have changed over time.</p>

<p>This is where MikeBooks comes in, providing an option to connect with other people in their city, see what books are being offered, and in turn offer their own books for exchange or sale, allowing for savings and even generating income.
</p>

## Project Scope

- Short term: The web application should present the user with an intuitive, pleasant, responsive interface that allows them to explore books and see more details about each book. (Name, year, publisher, author, description, exchange or sale, price, and photo)

- Medium term: It will allow the user to create their account and register their books, log in and out. Within their profile, a CRUD to manage the books they own (view, create, modify, delete books) and contact the owner via email or WhatsApp if they are logged in.

- Long term: Users will be able to view another user's profile, with the books they have, and leave comments about the exchange/sale experience with that user.

### Out of Scope:

The application will not check the condition of the books or the status of the exchange, nor will it implement payment gateways for the purchase/sale of these books. It will not be responsible for the shipping or pricing of the books.
